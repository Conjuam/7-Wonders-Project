        <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of Alexandria, was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom, during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. It was estimated to be at least 100 metres tall. It is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. For many centuries it was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world.</p>

        <p>The lighthouse was severely damaged by three earthquakes between 956 AD and 1323 and became an abandoned ruin. It was the third-longest surviving ancient wonder, after the <a href="mausoleum.html">Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</a> and the, still standing, <a href="pyramid-of-giza.html">Great Pyramid of Giza</a>, surviving in part until 1480.</p>
