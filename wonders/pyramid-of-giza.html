        <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known, and referred to as the "Pyramid of Khufu" or the "Pyramid of Cheops") is the oldest and largest Pyramid in the group of Pyramids on the outskirts of Giza, Greater Cairo, Egypt. It's the oldest of the "Seven Ancient Wonders of the World", and is the only one to be in, mostly, good shape.</p>

        <p>Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb for Pharaoh Khufu over a 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially standing at 146.5 metres (481 feet), it was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. It is estimated to weigh approximately 6 million metric tonnes, and consists of 2.3 million blocks of limestone and granite, some weighing as much as 80 metric tonnes. It was originally covered with limestone casing stones that formed a smooth exterior. What is seen today is the core structure, although a few casing stones can still be seen at the base. It was built by extracting huge stones from a quarry and lifting them into place. There are many scientific and alternative (conspiracy) theories about the exact construction technique.</p>
