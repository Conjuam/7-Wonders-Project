        <p>The "Mausoleum At Halicarnassus" or "Tomb Of Mausolus" was a tomb built between 353 and 350 BC in Halicarnassus (now: Bodrum, Turkey) for Mausolus, a native Anatolian from Caria and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene.</p>

        <p>The Mausoleum was roughly 45 m (148 ft) tall. The four sides were adorned with sculptural reliefs, each created by one of four Greek sculptors: Leochares, Bryaxis, Scopas of Paros, and Timotheus. The Mausoleum was considered to be such an architectural triumph that Antipater of Sidon identified it as one of his Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It ended up being destroyed by multiple earthquakes from the 12th to the 15th century.</p>
