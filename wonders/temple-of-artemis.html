        <p>The Temple of Artemis (also known as the Temple of Diana), was a Greek temple dedicated to an ancient, local form of the goddess Artemis (associated with Roman Godess Diana). It was located in Ephesus (near Selçuk in modern Turkey). It was completely rebuilt twice, once after a devastating flood and three hundred years later after an act of arson, and in its final form was one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</p>
