        <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World as listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon (near: Hillah, Babil province, Iraq).</p>

        <p>The Hanging Gardens are the only one of the Seven Wonders where the location has not been definitely confirmed. There are no existing Babylonian texts that mention the gardens, and no certain archaeological evidence has been found in Babylon. Three theories have been suggested to account for this:
            <ol>
                <li>That they were purely mythical, and the descriptions found in ancient Greek and Roman writings, represented a romantic ideal of an eastern garden</li>
                <li>They existed in Babylon, but were completely destroyed sometime around the first century AD</li>
                <li>The legend refers to a well-documented garden that King Sennacherib (704–681 BC) built in his capital city of Nineveh on the River Tigris, (near Mosul)</li>
            </ol>This is all merely speculation.</p>
