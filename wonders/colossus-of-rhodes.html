        <p>The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Greek sun-god Helios, erected in the city of Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name, by Chares of Lindos in 280 BC. It was about 33 Metres tall, or ⅔ the height of The Statue Of Liberty (from Feet to Crown).</p>

        <p>It collapsed during the earthquake of 226 BC, although parts of it were preserved. In accordance with an oracle, the Rhodians did not build it again. It is believed that Hadrian, in his reign, reerected the Colossus, but this is wrong. According to Suda, the Rhodians were called Colossaeans, because they erected the statue on the island. The actual location of the original monument is disputed.</p>
